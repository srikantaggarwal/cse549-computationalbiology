The final course project
— since it constitutes a significant fraction of the grade — should represent a substantial investment of
time. I expect that this project will be done in small groups. The deliverables will include a short (8 —
10 page) writeup, which should be a publishable quality document, even if we do not end up publishing it.
The deliverables will also include any related software (if applicable) and / or analysis scripts & data (if
applicable).
