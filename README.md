CSE549 - Computational Biology - "New Approaches to Base Calling"

Basecalling means predicting DNA bases (A,G,C or T) given raw signals. 
The goal of our project is to come up with a more accurate base-calling mechanism given the raw signals (~40 GB of data) from the Oxford Nanopore technology
We used two approaches  - supervised learning algorithm based on support vector machines and Na√Øve Bayes model to develop our basecaller.
